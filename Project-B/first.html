  <p class="description">The “ZEN” is an artwork that intends to remind people that we need to take care of our mental health because it is critical to focus on our mental state during these years.  Data reported that 77 percent of people experience stress that affects their physical health while 73 percent of people have stress that impacts their mental health. . Every day, we become exhausted and concerned about a variety of issues. By employing audio visualization effects and simple mouse interactions, I hope to provide individuals with a space to escape the complicated world, think about themselves, meditate, and calm their thoughts.</p>
