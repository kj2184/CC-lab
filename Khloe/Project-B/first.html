  <p class="description">Nowadays, due to certain events not only happening around the world, but all ages of people are also very prone to stress. Data reported that 77 percent of people experience stress that affects their physical health while 73 percent of people have stress that impacts their mental health. In this project, I  I am planning to create a small game to relieve stress by using both audio and interactive tools. Firstly, I create a bubble that will bounce with audio and when the mouse is pressed, it is going to disappear and will be generated again. Then bubbles integrate and create random shapes. In this stage, I will add audio visualization to relax the mind of people who are interacting with. Lastly, it will change to one big circle with audio visualization to give people space to breathe, relax and reflect on the problems that make people stressful.</p>
